## About
```
This is a simple website that uses filtering logic to filter through a data store of A2 license compliant motorcycles (in other words, motorcycles that are capped or under a certain engine power level for young riders).

I took this project on to learn about JavaScript and Babel, Vue.js and Amazon AWS. Though the website is not perfect in design, namely logic performed by the client on the front-end and minimal implementation of responsive design, it has taught me a lot about the basic concepts of Vue such as components and props etc.

The website was uploaded via AWS using S3 to be hosted on a bucket.
